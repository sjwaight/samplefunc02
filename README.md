# Azure Function to download S3 Object using Functions Extension

This C# HTTP-triggered Azure Function is designed to read a single CSV file from an S3 Bucket and display the contents on screen.

It uses a custom-developed Azure Functions extension which is designed to read the CSV file through configuration and not require the developer to write any glue to connect to AWS.

Debug locally (or in a Codespace) by renaming the sample.local.settings.json file to local.setting.json and then setting the values for a least-privilege account to access the target S3 bucket (read-only is fine).

Note: you can set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as environment variables (or use other AWS credential approaches). If you're using a Codespace you can set them as [Codespace Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces).

While they are included in this repository as references, and should be installed when you start VS Code or a Codespace, this solutions relies on:

- .NET 6 SDK
- Azure Functions Core Tools
- Azurite Azure Storage Emulator
